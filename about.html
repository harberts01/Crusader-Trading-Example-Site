        <p>A little about me, I was introduced to software programming at Kaplan University, Cedar Falls, IA in 2012. I took web development classes that focused on HTML and CSS specifically.<br><br>

        I have spent most of my career in the automotive field. I have had a strong passion for cars since I was young. I made my way to lead technician over the years and just felt that I wanted to keep my passion a hobby rather than a career. I started stock trading in 2018 and in 2020 I left the automotive industry to trade full time under Crusader Trading LLC. Working from home while staring at the stock market all day leaves a lot to be desired.<br><br>
        
        While trading full time I have enrolled in <a class="promineoTech" href="https://www.promineotech.com/";>Promineo Tech</a> to finish what I began all those years ago and become a Software Developer. I have held onto the skills I acquired in 2012. I maintain a non-profit website through the Word Press platform. I currently update the site as requested. (ihintl.org). I look forward to shaping my HTML and CSS skills and adding JavaScript, React.js, and Bootstrap to the list.
