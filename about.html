            <p>Crusader Trading LLC was started in 2020 by a gentleman named <name>Philip Harberts</name>. Phil grew up in the small
            Iowa town of Grundy Center. Graduating high school in 2010, Phil began his career as a Professional Automotive Technician. As his passion
            for cars grew into a great career, Phil felt that his motivation for working on cars outside of work was diminishing. Not wanting to give up
            his passion for fixing and tinkering with cars, he began investing in 2018 and from there he researched more in depth about the financial markets
            and how they operated inside and at the surface. As his interest in the markets grew he decided that 2020 would be the end of his automotive career
            and stepped into the role of trading.<br><br>
    
            Phil's trading journey started like every other traders, rough. He had big wins and big losses. One thing that was consistent throughout his new career
            was the education. Phil continued to learn about trading, taking classes and investing in education as much as the securities he was trading. From there 
            his knowledge grew and he felt it necessary to create and operate his trading under an LLC. Today he continues to trade under the name and help mentor people
            through a Discord channel where he is considered a <q>Head Trader</q> and mentors members as needed.</p>
